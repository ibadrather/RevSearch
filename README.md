# RevSearch

RevSearch is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) showcasing a car reverse image search application. It leverages cutting-edge machine learning, computer vision, and cloud-based technologies to provide an efficient and accurate image search experience. Built as a self-initiative, this project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow expertise.

**Note:** The deployment has been taken down due to running costs.

## Workflow

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image in various formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, etc.).
2. **Feature Encoding**: The uploaded image is encoded into a feature vector using a trained neural network encoder (EfficientNet).
3. **Similarity Search**: The encoded feature vector is compared to precomputed feature vectors in the database.
4. **Top Matches**: The system retrieves the top 10 image URLs based on similarity scores.
5. **Image Retrieval**: Top 10 images are fetched from AWS S3 storage via AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

> **Note**: RevSearch is currently not deployed due to associated operational costs.

## Challenges and Future Improvements

1. **Dataset Limitations**:
   - Cars dataset (16,185 images) is outdated, impacting accuracy for newer models.
2. **MVP Status**:
   - Currently demonstrates potential but requires further enhancements.
3. **Next Steps**:
   - Expand the dataset to include more images and newer models.
   - Refine search algorithms for improved accuracy and speed.
   - Incorporate user feedback for additional features and functionality.
